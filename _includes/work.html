				M&#257ori and Pacific students generally do not attain the same levels of tertiary success as New Zealanders of European descent, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Te R&#333pū &#256whina (&#256whina), an equity initiative at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand between 1999 and 2015, aimed to produce M&#257ori and Pacific professionals in STEM disciplines who contribute to Māori and Pacific community development and leadership. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was used to estimate posterior standardized completion rates for 3-year undergraduate and 2-year postgraduate degrees undertaken by non–Māori-Pacific and Māori-Pacific students. Results were consistent with an Āwhina effect, that is, &#256whina’s positive influence on (combined) Māori and Pacific success.

				I analyze the welfare effects of a policy of modern sector enlargement (MSENL), and a policy of increasing the efficiency of on-the-job search from the urban informal sector (IEOS) in a generalized Harris-Todaro model. I show that MSENL causes a Lorenz worsening of the income distribution and IEOS causes a Lorenz improvement. In a rare direct application of the Atkinson theorem, I conclude that MSENL decreases social welfare and IEOS increases social welfare for all anonymous, increasing and Schur-concave social welfare functions.

				We study the effect of tax expenditures on the stabilizing power of the tax system. We propose a micro-simulation strategy that exploits links that we identify between automatic stabilizers, tax expenditures, and effective marginal tax rates. Using U.S. tax return micro data from 2000 to 2010, we estimate that, on average, the mortgage interest deduction and the charitable contributions deduction decreased the ability of the tax system to absorb fluctuations in aggregate consumption by an average of 7.4 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.

				We develop an algorithm to compute exact solutions to the influence maximization problem using concepts from reverse influence sampling (RIS). We implement the algorithm using GPU resources to evaluate the empirical accuracy of theoretically-guaranteed greedy and RIS approximate solutions. We find that the approximations yield solutions that are remarkably close to optimal - usually achieving greater than 99% of the optimal influence spread. These results are consistent across a wide range of network structures.

				I examine the welfare effects of immigration on United States workers. I build a dynamic search and matching model in which immigrants and natives differ according to their outside options, separation rates, wealth holdings and skill composition. Immigration affects native-born welfare by i) altering the skill composition of the labor force, ii) lowering the expected hiring cost of firms, and iii) altering the rate of return on wealth. I demonstrate that the transition period, during which the economy adjusts to immigration, involves both higher returns to wealth and inferior labor market conditions in comparison to the long run steady state. Thus, accounting for transition dynamics shifts the welfare effects of immigration in favor of wealthy households at the expense of workers.

                Published reproductions or replications of economics research are rare. However, recent years have seen increased recognition of the important role of replication in the scientific endeavor. We describe and present the results of a large reproduction exercise in which we assess the reproducibility of research articles published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics over the last decade. 69 of 162 eligible replication attempts successfuly replicated the article's analysis 42.6%. A further 68 (42%) were at least partially successful. A total of 98 out of 303 (32.3%) relied on confidential or proprietary data, and were thus not reproducible by this project. We also conduct several bibliometric analyses of reproducible vs. non-reproducible articles.
