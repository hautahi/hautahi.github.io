## Notes to self about blog post files

- Add top matter to jupyter lab markdown file.
- Create new post-specific folder in the `blog_images` directory.
- For each image file, edit the markdown file by replacing the reference line from something like `![svg](image_name.svg)` to `![svg](/blog_images/post_name/image_name.svg){:.center-image}`.
